# 🧠 My AI/ML Journey  

This repo is my **learning diary** as I explore **Artificial Intelligence** first, then dive deeper into **Machine Learning**.  
I’m not trying to look polished here — this is where I test, fail, and learn in public.  

---

## 🌱 Why I Started  
AI isn’t just hype — it’s shaping everything.  
But before I get lost in buzzwords, I want to:  
- Understand **core AI concepts** (search, logic, decision-making, game theory)  
- Then move into **ML** (models, data, math, experiments)  
- Document my growth step by step  

---

## 📂 What’s Inside  
- **notes/** → summaries of AI/ML concepts, math breakdowns  
- **experiments/** → small AI & ML code tests  
- **projects/** → end-to-end builds when I feel ready  
- **resources/** → books, tutorials, and articles I’m using  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow eventually)  
- Jupyter Notebooks (my main lab)  
- GitHub (to embarrass myself in public with my code history 😅)

## 🗺️ Roadmap  

1. **AI Basics** → search algorithms, minimax, alpha–beta pruning  
2. **Knowledge & Reasoning** → logic, constraints, problem solving  
3. **Machine Learning Foundations** → regression, classification, clustering  
4. **Deep Learning** → neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, transformers  
5. **Applied AI/ML Projects** → real-world datasets, production-ready builds

## 📓 Progress Log  

### Phase 1 – AI Foundations  
- ✅ Adversarial search (minimax, alpha–beta pruning)  
- ⬜ Constraint satisfaction problems  
- ⬜ Logic & reasoning basics  
- ⬜ Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)  

### Phase 2 – Machine Learning  
- ⬜ Supervised learning (regression, classification)  
- ⬜ Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)  
- ⬜ Model evaluation & optimization  
- ⬜ Deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, transformers)

## ⚡ Mindset  
- **AI first → ML after → then keep climbing.**  
- Not aiming for perfect — just consistent progress.  
- Build, break, learn, repeat.
