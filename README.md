# 🧠 My AI & ML Journey with Python

Welcome to my personal repo where I’m documenting my journey into **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning** using Python.

---

## 🚀 Motivation
I believe learning AI requires two strong foundations:
1. **Python Programming** – writing clean, efficient code.
2. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** – understanding how to organize and manipulate data for performance.

This repo is where I’ll build projects, experiments, and notes as I grow from basics to advanced AI concepts.

---

## 📚 What I’m Learning
- ✅ Python syntax & best practices
- ✅ Problem solving with DSA (arrays, linked lists, stacks, recursion, etc.)
- 🔄 Mathematics for AI (linear algebra, probability, optimization)
- 🔮 Core AI/ML topics (search, classification, regression, neural networks, etc.)
- 🛠️ Building projects that combine theory + practice
